A CHIP-8 emulator written in Rust

### Resources to make the CHIP-8 Emulator 
- [OPCode table on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8#Opcode_table)

### What is it?
The **CHIP-8 Emulator** is a Virtual Machine to emulate the hardware that the interpreted language **CHIP-8** was run on,like COSMAC VIP or the Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid 1970s. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed. Many of the classic video games like Pong, Space Invaders, Tetris, and Pacman were ported to CHIP-8. It is supposed to be a good first project so I am giving it a shot :D
